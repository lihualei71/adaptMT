Description: Adaptive p-value thresholding (AdaPT) for multiple hypothesis testing with side 
  information. This package includes both a framework that allows the user to specify any 
  algorithm to learn local FDR and a pool of convenient functions that implement specific 
  algorithms. The details of AdaPT are described in our paper linked to via the URL below.
